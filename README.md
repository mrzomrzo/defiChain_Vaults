# defichain_vaults
this desktopapp its a Extension to manage Vaults with a GUI because the DFI-Desktop-Wallet dont have a GUI to manage the vaults, you must manage your Vaults from the CLI-comandline :(
With my app you can create Vaults, manage Vaults, manage Loans, manage Collateral and you can see your Balance of your Wallet.
In the next few days, I will expand the app to also profit from the FutureSwaps.


# How to use and install
1. you need a Fullnode-Wallet, download the DeFi Wallet desktop app  https://defichain.com/downloads
2. run your DFI-DesktopWallet, the Wallet must running to connect myAPP
3. bevor you run myApp(FullNode_Wallet.exe), open the jsonFile - DFI-Fullnode-Vaults\DFI-Fullnode-Vaults\bin\Debug\settings.json
4. to find your settings on the Path - C:\Users\{yourUserName}\.defi\defi.conf
5. edit the Key "address" , "node_User" , "node_Password" and optional "node_URL"
6. run the App - DFI-Fullnode-Vaults\DFI-Fullnode-Vaults\bin\Debug\FullNode_Wallet.exe
